# MULTIPLE PINTERS
  > Creating pointers or valuse that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition

## AN EXAMPLE 
  Write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers. the function should find the first pair where the sum is 0; return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist

```javascript 
 sumZero([-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]) // [-3, 3]
 sumZero([-2,0,1,3]) //undefined
 sumZero([1,2,3]) // undefined
