## Devide and conqure Pattern

#### This pattern involes dividing a data set into smaller chunks and reapting a process with a subset of data. This pattern can tremedously decrese time complexity

# An EXAMPLE  

  ##### Given a sorted array of intigers, write a function called search, that accepts a value and returns the index where the value possed to the function is located. if the value is is not found , return -1 

  ```js 
   search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 4) //4 
   search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] 6) // 6

  ```
  ...
  ```  Binary search follow the divide and conqure rule ```
